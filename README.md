# K-pop Album Wishlist Project

This is the code for my Kpop Album Wishlist webapp. Right now, it is created with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. There are plans to refactor this code to include React.

## V 1 Feature Overview

- Add album with album name, group/artist name, link to purchase and album price.
- Check albums that have been purchased already.
- See cumulative price of all albums on the wishlist.

## Future Plans

- Add purchased tab that will display all albums that have already been purchased
- Improve design to include signature color theme
